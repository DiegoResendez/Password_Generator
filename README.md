# Password_Generator
In this project I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This project helped me learn about randomizing lists and allowing user to set character length from 8 to 128.
